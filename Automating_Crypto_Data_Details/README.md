# Automating Web Scraping for Crypto Data

In this project what I basically do is: 
1. I created a method for getting the data from an open api for fetching crypto related data. 
2. After getting that data, I basicaly performed some transformation on it, so that it can be understandable.
3. After that, I use some graphs to demonstrate the data we collected from api, for analysis. 

Technologies that I used: 
Python(Panda) - For connecting with the api, and doing transformations.
Python(Seaborn, Matplotlib) - for ploting the graphs and charts to understand the data. 

You can just go through it, you will be able to understand, It's not that big, or hard.

Keep Coding.
